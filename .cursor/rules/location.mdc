# Cursor Rules Location Standards

## Directory Structure
Rules must be placed in the following structure:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Always use .mdc extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

## Placement Rules
### Required Location
- All rule files must be in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Files must end in `.mdc` extension
- Path must match pattern: `./cursor/rules/*.mdc`

### Prohibited Locations
Never place rule files in:
- Project root directory
- Subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
- Any other location

## File Format
Each rule file must contain:
1. YAML frontmatter with metadata
2. Rule content wrapped in `<rule>` tags
3. Clear section headers and organization

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Placement
```
.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
.cursor/rules/code-style.mdc
```

### ❌ Incorrect Placement
```
rules/my-rule.mdc
my-rule.mdc
.rules/my-rule.mdc
```

## Validation
Files will be validated against:
- Correct file extension (.mdc)
- Proper location in `.cursor/rules/`
- Valid rule content structure
